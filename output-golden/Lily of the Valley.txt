Lily of the Valley
Verse 1:
1. I have found a friend in Jesus,
He’s everything to me,
He’s the fairest of
Ten thousand to my soul;
The Lily of the Valley
In Him alone I see
All I need to cleanse and
Make me fully whole.
In sorrow He’s my comfort,
In trouble He’s my stay;
He tells me every
Care on Him to roll.

Chorus:
He’s the Lily of the Valley,
The Bright and Morning Star,
He’s the fairest of
Ten thousand to my soul. (2)

Verse 2:
2. He all my grief has taken,
And all my sorrows borne;
In temptation He’s my
Strong and mighty tower;
I have all for Him forsaken
And all my idols torn
From my heart and now
He keeps me by His power.
Though all the world forsake me,
And Satan tempt me sore,
Through Jesus I shall
Safely reach the goal.

Chorus

Verse 3:
3. He will never, never leave me,
Nor yet forsake me here,
While I live by faith
And do His blessèd will;
A wall of fire about me
I’ve nothing now to fear,
From His manna He my
Hungry soul shall fill.
Then sweeping up to glory
To see His blessèd face,
Where the rivers of
Delight shall ever roll.

Chorus
