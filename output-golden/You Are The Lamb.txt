You Are The Lamb
Versr 1:
1. On my the heart play the
Songs of redemption
Golden bowls filled with
Prayers intersession
Togethter we make
A new song of worship and praise
For You made us a kingdom of priests
Who will reign over all of the earth
We're destined to be
The servants who carry Your name

Pre-chorus:
We've overcome
Bought by the blood of the lamb
And by the word of our testimoy
We will proclaim it again

Chorus:[3]
You are the Lamb
Mighty and most Holy One
Worthy to open the scroll
You are "I AM"
Shout to the ends of the earth
Forever Your kingdom will stand

Chorus 2:
You are the Lamb

Verse 2:
2. With your blood You have
Purchased salvation
Every tribe every language
And nation
They lift up their voice
To worship the Lamb Who was slain
They are joined by the
Thousands of angels
As they're singing this
Heavenly song
Wisdom and strength
Honor and glory and praise
