Still
Verse 1:
1. Hide me now
Under Your wings
Cover me
Within Your mighty hand

When the oceans rise and thunders roar
I will soar with You above the storm
Father You are King over the flood
I will be still and know You are God

Verse 2:
2. Find rest my soul
In Christ alone
Know His power
In quietness and trust
