I Gave My Life For Thee
Verse 1:
1. I gave My life for thee
My precious blood I shed
That thou mightst ransomed be
And quickened from the dead
I gave, I gave My life for thee
What hast thou done for Me? (2)

Verse 2:
2. My Father's house of light
My glory-circled throne
I left for earthly night
For wanderings sad and lone
I left, I left it all for thee
Hast thou left aught for Me? (2)

Verse 3:
3. I suffered much for thee
More than thy tongue can tell
Of bitterest agony
To rescue thee from hell
I've borne, I've borne it all for thee
What hast thou borne for Me? (2)

Verse 4:
4. Long years were spent for me
In weariness and woe 		
That  -  through  -  eternity
Thy glory I might know
Long years were spent for me, for me
Have I spent one for Thee? (2)

Verse 5:
5. Oh, let my life be given
My years for Thee be spent
World-fetters all be riven
And joy with suff’ring blent
Thou gav’st Thyself for me, for me
I give myself to Thee (2)
