It’s Christmas!
Verse 1:
1. Away in a manger
No crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus
Laid down his sweet head
The stars in the bright sky
Looked down where he lay
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep on the hay

Verse 2:
2. The cattle are lowing
The baby awakes
But little Lord Jesus
No crying he makes
I love you Lord Jesus
Look down from the sky
And stay by my side
Until morning is nigh.

Chorus:
It’s Christmas!
The angels are singing
And I know the reason
The Savior is born
It’s Christmas!
The bells are ringing
And I feel like shouting
Joy to the world!

Verse 3:
3. Be near me Lord Jesus
I ask you to stay
Close by me forever
And love me I pray
Bless all the dear children
In your tender care
And take us to heaven
To live with you there

Chorus

Verse 4:
4. Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere!
Go, tell it on the mountain that
Jesus Christ is born!

Verse 4
