Before The Throne Of God Above
Verse 1:
1. Before the Throne of God above
I have a strong and perfect plea
A great High Priest whose name is Love
Who ever lives and pleads for me.
My name is graven on His hands
My name is written on His heart
I know that while in Heaven He stands
No tongue can bid me thence depart (2)

Verse 2:
2. When Satan tempts me to despair
And tells me of the guilt within
Upward I look and see Him there
Who made an end to all my sin.
Because the sinless Savior died
My sinful soul is counted free
For God the Just is satisfied
To look on Him and pardon me (2)

Bridge:
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
Praise the One
Risen Son of God

Verse 3:
3. Behold Him there! The risen Lamb
My perfect, spotless Righteousness
The great unchangeable I AM
The King of glory and of grace!
One with Himself I cannot die
My soul is purchased with His blood
My life is hid with Christ on high
With Christ, my Savior and my God (2)
