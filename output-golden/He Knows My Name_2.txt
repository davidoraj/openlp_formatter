He Knows My Name
Verse 1:
1. I have a maker
He formed my heart,
Before even time began
My life was in His hands (2)

Chorus:
He knows my name
He knows my every thought,
He sees each tear that falls
And hears me when I call

Verse 2:
2. I have a father,
He calls me His own
He'll never leave me,
No matter where I go (2)

Chorus

Chorus 2:
He knows my name
He knows my every thought,
He sees each tear that falls
And hears me when I call (2)
