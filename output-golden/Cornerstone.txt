Cornerstone
Verse 1:
1. My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus blood and righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly trust in Jesus name

Verse 1

Chorus:
Christ alone, cornerstone
Weak made strong, in the Saviour's love
Through the storm
He is Lord, Lord of all

Verse 2:
2. When darkness seems to hide His face
I rest on His unchanging grace
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil (2)

Verse 3:
3. When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh, may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless stand before the throne
