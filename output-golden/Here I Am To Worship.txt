Here I Am To Worship
Verse 1:[3]
1. Light of the world
You stepped down into darkness
Opened my eyes, let me see
Beauty that made this heart adore You
Hope of a life spent with You

Chorus:
Here I am to worship
Here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that
You're my God
You're altogether lovely
Altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me

Verse 2:
2. King of all days oh so highly exalted
Glorious in heaven above
Humbly You came to the earth You created
All for love's sake became poor

Chorus

Bridge:
I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross (4)

Chorus
