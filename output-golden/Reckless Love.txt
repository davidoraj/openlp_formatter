Reckless Love
Verse 1:
Before I spoke a word
You were singing over me
You have been so..
So good to me
Before I took a breath
You breathed Your life in me
You have been so..
So kind to me

Chorus:[3]
Oh, the overwhelming
Never-ending
Reckless love of God
Oh, it chases me down
Fights ‘til I’m found
Leaves the ninety-nine
I couldn’t earn it
I don’t deserve it
Still You give Yourself away
Oh, the overwhelming
Never-ending
Reckless love of God

Verse 2:
When I was Your foe
Still Your love fought for me
You have been so..
So good to me
When I felt no worth
You paid it all for me
You have been so..
So kind to me

Chorus

Bridge:[3]
There’s no shadow You won’t light up
Mountain You won’t climb up
Coming after me
There’s no wall You won’t kick down
Lie You won’t tear down
Coming after me

Bridge
Bridge
Bridge

Chorus
