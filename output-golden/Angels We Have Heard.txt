Angels We Have Heard
Verse 1:
1. Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains

Chorus:
Gloria In Excelsis Deo
Gloria In Excelsis Deo

Verse 3:
3. Come to Bethlehem and see
Him Whose birth the angels sing;
Come, adore on bended knee
Christ the Lord, the newborn King

Chorus

Verse 4:
Hark! the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King!
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled
Joyful all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With angelic hosts proclaim
"Christ is born in Bethlehem
Hark! the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King!

Verse 5:
Hail the Heav'n-born Prince of Peace
Hail the Son of Righteousness
Light and life to all He brings
Ris'n with healing in His wings
Mild He lays His glory by
Born that man no more may die
Born to raise the sons of earth
Born to give them second birth
Hark! the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King!

Chorus
