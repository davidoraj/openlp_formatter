Raise A Hallelujah
Verse 1:
I raise a hallelujah
In the presence of my enemies
I raise a hallelujah
Louder than the unbelief
I raise a hallelujah
My weapon is a melody
I raise a hallelujah
Heaven comes to fight for me

Chorus:
I’m gonna sing
In the middle of the storm
Louder and louder
You’re gonna hear my praises roar
Up from the ashes
Hope will arise
Death is defeated
The King is alive

Verse 2:
I raise a hallelujah
With everything inside of me
I raise a hallelujah
I will watch the darkness flee
I raise a hallelujah
In the middle of the mystery
I raise a hallelujah
Fear you lost your hold on me

Chorus

Bridge:
Sing a little louder
(In the presence of my enemies)
Sing a little louder
(Louder than the unbelief)
Sing a little louder
(My weapon is a melody)
Sing a little louder
(Heaven comes to fight for me)

Chorus 2:
I raise a hallelujah
