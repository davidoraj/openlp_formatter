Standing On The Promises
Verse 1:
1. Standing on the promises
of Christ my King
Through eternal ages
Let His praises ring
Glory in the highest
I will shout and sing
Standing on the promises
of God

Chorus:[3]
Standing, standing
Standing on the promises
of God my Savior
Standing, standing
I’m standing on the
Promises of God

Verse 2:
2. Standing on the promises
That cannot fail
When the howling storms of doubt
and fear assail
By the living Word of God
I shall prevail
Standing on the promises
of God

Chorus

Verse 3:
3. Standing on the promises
of Christ the Lord
Bound to Him eternally
By love’s strong cord
Overcoming daily with
The Spirit’s sword
Standing on the promises
of God

Chorus

Verse 4:
4. Standing on the promises
I cannot fall
Listening every moment
To the Spirit’s call
Resting in my Savior
As my all in all
Standing on the promises
of God

Chorus
