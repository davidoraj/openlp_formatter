Trust And Obey
Verse 1:
1. When we walk with the Lord
In the light of His word
What a glory
He sheds on our way
While we do His good will
He abides with us still
And with all who will
Trust and obey

Chorus:
Trust and obey
For there's no other way
To be happy in Jesus
But to trust and obey

Verse 2:
2. Not a burden we bear
Not a sorrow we share
But our toil He doth
Richly repay
Not a grief or a loss
Not a frown or a cross
But is blest if we
Trust and obey

Chorus

Verse 3:
3. But we never can prove
The delights of His love
Until all on the
Altar we lay
For the favor He shows
For the joy He bestows
Are for them who will
Trust and obey

Chorus

Verse 4:
4. Then in fellowship sweet
We will sit at His feet
Or we'll walk by
His side in the way
What He says we will do
Where He sends we will go
Never fear only
Trust and obey

Chorus
