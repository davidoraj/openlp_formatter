Joyful Joyful We Adore Thee
Verse 1:
1. Joyful joyful we adore You
God of glory Lord of love
Hearts unfold like flow'rs before You
Op'ning to the sun above.
Melt the clouds of sin and sadness
Drive the dark of doubt away
Giver of immortal gladness
Fill us with the light of day!

Verse 2:
2. All Your works with joy surround You
Earth and heav'n reflect Your rays
Stars and angels sing around You
Center of unbroken praise
Field and forest vale and mountain
Flow'ry meadow flashing sea
Chanting bird and flowing fountain
Praising You eternally!

Verse 3:
3. Always giving and forgiving
Ever blessing ever blest
Well-spring of the joy of living
Ocean-depth of happy rest!
Loving Father Christ our Brother
Let Your light upon us shine
Teach us how to love each other
Lift us to the joy divine.

Verse 4:
4. Mortals join the mighty chorus
Which the morning stars began
God's own love is reigning oâ€™er us
Joining people hand in hand.
Ever singing march we onward
Victors in the midst of strife
Joyful music leads us sunward
In the triumph song of life.
