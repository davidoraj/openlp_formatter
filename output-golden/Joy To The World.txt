Joy To The World
Verse 1:
1. Joy to the world the Lord is come
Let earth receive her King
Let every heart
Prepare Him room
And heaven and nature sing (2)
And heaven and heavâ€™n and nature sing

Verse 2:
2. Joy to the earth the Savior reigns
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods
Rocks hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat repeat
The sounding joy

Verse 3:
3. No more let sins and sorrows grow
Nor thorns infest the ground
He comes to make
His blessings flow
Far as the curse is found
Far as the curse is found
Far as far as
The curse is found

Verse 4:
4. He rules the world with truth and grace
And makes the nations prove
The glories of
His righteousness
And wonders of his love
And wonders of his love
And wonders wonders
Of His love
