Sweet Hour Of Prayer
Verse 1:
1. Sweet hour of prayer
Sweet hour of prayer
That calls me from
A world of care
And bids me at
My Father's throne
Make all my wants
And wishes known
In seasons of
Distress and grief
My soul has often
Found relief
And oft escaped
The tempter's snare
By Thy return
Sweet hour of prayer

Verse 2:
2. Sweet hour of prayer
Sweet hour of prayer
The joys I feel
The bliss I share
Of those whose anxious
Spirits burn
With strong desires
For Thy return!
With such I hasten
To the place
Where God my Savior
Shows His face
And gladly take
My station there
And wait for thee
Sweet hour of prayer

Verse 3:
3. Sweet hour of prayer
Sweet hour of prayer
Thy wings shall my
Petition bear
To him whose truth
And faithfulness
Engage the waiting
Soul to bless
And since he bids
Me seek His face
Believe His word
And trust His grace
I'll cast on Him
My every care
And wait for thee
Sweet hour of prayer
