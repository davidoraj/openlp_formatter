Softly And Tenderly
Verse 1:
1. Softly and tenderly
Jesus is calling
Calling for you
And for me
See on the portals
He's waiting and watching
Watching for you
And for me

Chorus:
Come home, come home
Ye who are weary come home
Earnestly tenderly Jesus is calling
Calling O sinner come home

Verse 2:
2. Why should we tarry
When Jesus is pleading
Pleading for you
And for me
Why should we linger
And heed not His mercies
Mercies for you
And for me

Chorus

Verse 3:
3. Time is now fleeting
The moments are passing
Passing from you
And from me
Shadows are gathering
Deathbeds are coming
Coming for you
And for me

Chorus

Verse 4:
4. O for the wonderful
Love He has promised
Promised for you
And for me
Though we have sinned
He has mercy and pardon
Pardon for you
And for me

Chorus
