I Stand Amazed
Verse 1:
1. I stand amazed in the presence
Of Jesus the Nazarene
And wonder how He could love me
A sinner, condemned, unclean

Oh, how marvelous! Oh, how wonderful!
And my song shall ever be
Oh, how marvelous! Oh, how wonderful!
Is my Savior’s love for me!

Verse 2:

He made them His very own
He bore the burden on Calv’ry
And suffered and died alone

His face I at last shall see,
‘Twill be my joy thro’ the ages
To sing of His love for me.
