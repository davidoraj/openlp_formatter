Showers of Blessing

1. There shall be showers of blessing
This is the promise of love
There shall be seasons refreshing
Sent from the Savior above

Showers of blessing
Showers of blessing we need
Mercy-drops round us are falling
But for the showers we plead

2. There shall be showers of blessing
O that today they might fall
Now as to God weâ€™re confessing
Now as on Jesus we call

3. There shall be showers of blessing
If we but trust and obey
There shall be seasons refreshing
If we let God have His way
