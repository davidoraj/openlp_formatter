Living Hope
Verse 1:
1. How great the chasm
That lay between us
How high the mountain
I could not climb
In desperation
I turned to Heaven
And spoke Your name
Into the night
Then through the darkness
Your loving kindness
Tore through the shadows
Of my soul
The work is finished
The end is written
Jesus Christ
My living hope

Verse 2:
2. Who could imagine
So great a mercy
What heart could fathom
Such boundless grace
The God of ages
Stepped down from glory
To wear my sin
And bear my shame
The cross has spoken
I am forgiven
The King of Kings
Calls me His own
Beautiful Savior
I’m Yours forever
Jesus Christ
My living hope

Chorus:
Hallelujah!
Praise the One who set me free
Hallelujah!
Death has lost its grip on me
You have broken every chain
There’s salvation in Your name
Jesus Christ
My living hope

Chorus

Verse 3:
3. Then came the morning
That sealed the promise
Your buried body
Began to breathe
Out of the silence
The roaring lion
Declared the grave
Has no claim on me

Verse 3

Verse 4:
Jesus Yours is the victory

Chorus 2:
Jesus Christ
My living hope
Oh God, You're my living hope
