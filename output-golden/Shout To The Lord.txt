Shout To The Lord
Verse:
My Jesus, my Savior
Lord there is none like You
All of my days, I want to praise
The wonders of Your mighty love
My Comfort, my Shelter
Tower of Refuge and Strength
Let every breath, all that I am
Never cease to worship You

Chorus:
Shout to the Lord
All the earth let us sing
Power and majesty
Praise to the King
Mountains bow down
And the sea will roar
At the sound
Of Your Name
I sing for joy at the
Work of Your hands
Forever I’ll love You
Forever I’ll stand

Chorus 2:
Nothing compares to
The promise I have in You
