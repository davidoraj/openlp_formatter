The First Noel
Verse 1:
1. The first Noel - the angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds - in fields as they lay
In fields where they - lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night - that was so deep

Chorus:
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

Verse 2:
2. They looked up - and saw a star
Shining in the east - beyond them far
And to the earth - it gave great light
And so it continued - both day and night

Chorus

Verse 3:
3. Then entered in - those Wise Men three
Full reverently - upon the knee
And offered there - in his presence
Their gold and myrrh - and frankincense

Chorus

Verse 4:
4. Then let us all - with one accord
Sing praises to - our heavenly Lord
That hath made heav'n - and earth of naught
And with his blood - mankind hath bought

Chorus
