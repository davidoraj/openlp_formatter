My Hope Is Built On Nothing Less
Chorus:
On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand (2)

Verse 1:
1. My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly lean on Jesus' name

Chorus

Verse 2:
2. When darkness veils His lovely face
I rest on His unchanging grace
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil

Chorus

Verse 3:
3 His oath, His covenant, His blood
Support me in the whelming flood
When all around my soul gives way
He then is all my hope and stay

Chorus

Verse 4:
4 When He shall come with trumpet sound
O may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless to stand before the throne

Chorus
