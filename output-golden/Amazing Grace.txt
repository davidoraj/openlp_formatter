Amazing Grace
Verse 1:
1. Amazing Grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind, but now I see

Verse 2:
2. ‘Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Verse 3:
3. Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come
‘Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home

Verse 4:
4. The Lord has promised good to me
His Word my hope secures
He will my Shield and Portion be
As long as life endures
