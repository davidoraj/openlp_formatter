O precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Nothing but the blood of Jesus
For my cleansing this my plea
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Naught of good that I have done
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Chorus

Nothing but the blood of Jesus
This is all my righteousness
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
