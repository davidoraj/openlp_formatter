It Is Well With My Soul
Verse 1:
1. When peace like a river
Attendeth my way
When sorrows like sea
Billows roll
Whatever my lot
Thou hast taught me to say
It is well
It is well with my soul

Chorus:
It is well with my soul
it is well, it is well with my soul

Verse 2:
2. Though Satan should buffet
Though trials should come
Let this
Blest assurance control
That Christ has regarded
My helpless estate
And has shed his own blood
For my soul

Chorus

Verse 3:
3. My sin oh, the bliss
Of this glorious thought!
My sin, not in part
But the whole
Is nailed to the cross
And I bear it no more
Praise the Lord,
Praise the Lord, O my soul!

Chorus

Verse 4:
4. O Lord, haste the day
When my faith shall be sight
The clouds be rolled back
As a scroll
The trump shall resound
And the Lord shall descend
Even so, it is well
With my soul

Chorus
