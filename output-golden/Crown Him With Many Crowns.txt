Crown Him With Many Crowns
Verse 1:
1. Crown Him with many crowns
The Lamb upon His Throne
Hark! How the heavenly anthem drowns
All music but its own
Awake my soul and sing
Of Him who died for me
And hail Him as my matchless King
Through all eternity

Verse 2:
2. Crown Him the Lord of Life
Who triumphed over the grave
And rose victorious in the strife
For those He came to save
His glories now we sing
Who died and rose on high
Who died eternal life to bring
And lives that death may die

Verse 3:
3. Crown Him the Lord of Peace
Whose power a scepter sways
From pole to pole, that wars may cease
And all be prayer and praise
His reign shall know no end
And round His piercèd feet
Fair flowers of paradise extend
Their fragrance ever sweet

Verse 4:
4. Crown Him the Lord of Heav’n
Enthroned in worlds above
Crown Him the King to Whom is giv’n
The wondrous name of Love
Crown Him with many crowns
As thrones before Him fall
Crown Him, ye kings, with many crowns
For He is King of all

Verse 5:
5. Crown Him the Lord of Love
Behold His hands and side
Those wounds, yet visible above
In beauty glorified
All hail, Redeemer, hail!
For Thou has died for me
Thy praise and glory shall not fail
Throughout eternity

Bridge:
All hail, Redeemer, hail!
For Thou has died for me
Thy praise and glory shall not fail
Throughout eternity
