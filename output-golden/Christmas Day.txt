1. Joy to the world
On a night like no other

God is with us
Rich and the poor
Let us come, and adore Him
Rest in His peace
And bow before Him

Sing all you people
The Lord Almighty reigns
Sing every creature of God
Come bless His name

Over deserts and oceans
The darkness was deep
But never hopeless
Redemption came
His name is Jesus

For the Lord our
God Almighty reigns
