When I Look Into Your Holiness
Verse 1:
When I look into Your holiness
When I gaze into Your loveliness
When all things that surround
Become shadows in the light of You

Verse 2:[4]
When I've found the joy
Of reaching Your heart
When my will becomes
Enthroned in Your love
When all things that surround
Become shadows in the light of You

Chorus:
I worship You
I worship You
The reason I live (I live)
Is to worship You
