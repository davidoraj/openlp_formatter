Great is Thy faithfulness

1. Great is Thy faithfulness O God my Father
There is no shadow of turning with Thee
Thou changest not Thy compassions, they fail not
As Thou hast been Thou forever wilt be

Great is Thy faithfulness (2)
Morning by morning new mercies I see
All I have needed Thy hand hath provided
Great is Thy faithfulness Lord unto me

2. Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth
Thine own dear presence to cheer and to guide
Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow
Blessings all mine with ten thousand beside
