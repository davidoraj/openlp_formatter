Jesus Paid It All
Verse 1:
1. I hear the savior say
Thy strength indeed is small
Child of weakness, watch and pray
Find in me thine all in all

Chorus:
Jesus paid it all
All to Him I owe
Sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

Verse 2:
2. Lord, now indeed I find
Thy power and thine alone
Can change the leper's spots
And melt the heart of stone

Chorus

Verse 3:
3. And when before the throne
I stand in Him complete
Jesus died my soul to save
My lips shall still repeat

Chorus

Chorus 2:
Sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

Bridge:
O praise the one who paid my debt
And raised this life up from the dead (4)

Chorus
