The Old Rugged Cross
Verse 1:
1. On a hill far away
Stood an old rugged cross
The emblem of suff’ring
And shame
And I love that old cross
Where the Dearest and Best
For a world of lost sinners was slain

Chorus:
So I’ll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown

Verse 2:
2. Oh, that old rugged cross
So despised by the world
Has a wondrous attraction
For me
For the dear Lamb of God
Left His glory above
To bear it to dark Calvary

Chorus

Verse 3:
3. In the old rugged cross
Stained with blood so divine
A wondrous beauty
I see
For ’twas on that old cross
Jesus suffered and died
To pardon and sanctify me

Chorus

Verse 4:
4. To that old rugged cross
I will ever be true
Its shame and reproach
Gladly bear
Then He'll call me some day
To my home far away
Where His glory forever I'll share

Chorus
