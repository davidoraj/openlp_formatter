There Is A Fountain
Verse 1:
1. There is a fountain filled with blood
Drawn from Immanuelâ€™s veins
And sinners plunged beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains
And sinners plunged beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains

Verse 2:
2. The dying thief rejoiced to see
That fountain in his day
And there may I though vile as he
Wash all my sins away
Wash all my sins away
Wash all my sins away
And there may I though vile as he
Wash all my sins away

Verse 4:
4. Ever since by faith I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply
Redeeming love has been my theme
And shall be till I die
And shall be till I die
And shall be till I die
Redeeming love has been my theme
And shall be till I die

Bridge:
Wash all my sins away
Wash all my sins away
Redeeming love has been my theme
And shall be till I die
