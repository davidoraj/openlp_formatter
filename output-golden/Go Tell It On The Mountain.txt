Go Tell It On The Mountain
Chorus:
Go, tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go, tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born

Verse 1:
1. While shepherds kept their watching
O'er silent flocks by night
Behold, throughout the heavens
There shone a holy light

Chorus

Verse 2:
2. The shepherds feared and trembled
When lo, above the earth
Rang out the angel chorus
That hailed our Saviorâ€™s birth

Chorus

Verse 3:
3. Down in a lowly manger
The humble Christ was born,
And God sent us salvation
That blessed Christmas morn
