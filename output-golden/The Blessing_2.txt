The Lord bless you
And keep you
Make His face shine upon you
And be gracious to you
The Lord turn His face towards you
And give you peace

And your family, and your children
And their children, and their children

May His presence go before you
And behind you, and beside you
All around you, and within you
He is with you, He is with you

In your coming, and your going
In your weeping, and rejoicing
He is for you, He is for you
