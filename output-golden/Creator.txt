Creator
Verse 1:
Praise Him all you creatures
Great and small
Praise Him summer, winter
Spring and fall
Howling wind, rushing streams
Rolling hills and crashing seas
Lift your voice
And worship your Creator
  
Verse 2:
Praise Him gleaming moon
And burning sun
Praise Him all you
Spinning spheres above
Shining stars, golden beams
Choir made of galaxies 
Lift your voice
And worship your Creator

Chorus:[2]
Holy, You are holy
Earth and heaven, Sing forever
Holy, You are holy
All creation, Praise Creator

Verse 3:
Praise Him who stepped into
What He made
Paid our debt and pulled us
From the grave
Every heart He set free
Every soul that’s been redeemed
Lift your voice
And worship your Creator

Chorus

Bridge:
This my great and everlasting hope
I’ve been saved and heaven is my home
I can’t wait for that day
When I see You face to face
For I was made to magnify my Maker
Yes I was saved to walk beside my Savior
I’m created to worship my Creator

Chorus
Chorus

Chorus 2:
Yes all creation, Praise Creator
