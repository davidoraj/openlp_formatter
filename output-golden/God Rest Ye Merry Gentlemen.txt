God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen
Verse 1:
1. God rest you merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our Savior
Was born on Christmas Day
To save us all from Satan's pow'r
When we were gone astray

Chorus:
O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

Verse 2:
2. In Bethlehem in Israel
This blessed Babe was born
And laid within a manger
Upon this blessed morn
For which His Mother Mary
Did nothing take in scorn

Chorus

Verse 3:
3. From God our heav'nly Father
A blessed angel came
And unto certain shepherds
Brought tidings of the same
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by name

Chorus

Verse 5:
5. Now to the Lord sing praises
All you within this place
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other new embrace
This holy tide of Christmas
All other doth deface

Chorus
