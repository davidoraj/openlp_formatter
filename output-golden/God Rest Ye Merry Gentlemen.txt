God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen

1 God rest you merry, gentlemen,
let nothing you dismay,
remember Christ our Savior
was born on Christmas Day
to save us all from Satan's pow'r
when we were gone astray.
Refrain:
O tidings of comfort and joy,
comfort and joy;
O tidings of comfort and joy.
2 From God our heav'nly Father
a blessed angel came
and unto certain shepherds
brought tidings of the same;
how that in Bethlehem was born
the Son of God by name. [Refrain]
3 "Fear not," then said the angel,
"Let nothing you affright;
this day is born a Savior
of a pure virgin bright,
to free all those who trust in Him
from Satan's pow'r and might." [Refrain]
4 The shepherds at those tidings
rejoiced much in mind,
and left their flocks afeeding,
in tempest, storm, and wind,
and went to Bethlehem straightway,
this blessed Babe to find. [Refrain]
5 Now to the Lord sing praises
all you within this place,
and with true love and brotherhood
each other new embrace;
this holy tide of Christmas
all other doth deface. [Refrain]
