Praise Medley
Verse 1:
1. I'll praise in the valley
Praise on the mountain
I'll praise when I'm sure
Praise when I'm doubting
I'll praise when outnumbered
Praise when surrounded
'Cause praise is the water
My enemies drown in
As long as I'm breathing
I've got a reason to

Chorus:
Praise the Lord
Oh, my soul
Praise the Lord
Oh, my soul

Verse 2:
2. I'll praise when I feel it
And I'll praise when I don't
I'll praise 'cause I know
You're still in control
'Cause my praise is a weapon
It's more than a sound
More than a sound
My praise is the shout
That brings Jericho down
As long as I'm breathing
I've got a reason to

Chorus

Chorus 2:
I won't be quiet
My God is alive
So how could I
Keep it inside?
Praise the Lord
Oh, my soul

Bridge:
I'll praise 'cause You're sovereign
Praise 'cause You reign
Praise 'cause You rose
And defeated the grave
I'll praise 'cause You're faithful
Praise 'cause You're true
Praise 'cause there's
Nobody greater than You

Chorus 3:
I won't be quiet

Verse 3:
1. Would you be free
From the burden of sin?
There's power in the blood
power in the blood
Would you o'er evil a victory win?
There's wonderful power in the blood

Chorus 4:
There is power, power
Wonder-working power
In the blood
Of the Lamb
There is power, power
Wonder-working power
In the precious blood
Of the Lamb

Verse 4:
2. Would you be free from your
Passion and pride?
There's power in the blood
Power in the blood
Come for a cleansing to
Calvary's tide
There's wonderful power in the blood
