Jesus Loves Me
Verse 1:
1. Jesus loves me this I know
For the Bible tells me so
Little ones to Him belong
They are weak but He is strong

Chorus:
Yes Jesus loves me
Yes Jesus loves me
Yes Jesus loves me
The Bible tells me so

Verse 2:
2. Jesus loves me He who died
Heaven's gate to open wide
He will wash away my sin
Let His little child come in

Chorus

Verse 3:
Jesus loves me loves me still
Though I'm very weak and ill
From His shining throne on high
Comes to watch me where I lie

Chorus

Verse 4:
Jesus loves me He will stay
Close beside me all the way
Then His little child will take
Up to heav'n for His dear sake

Chorus
