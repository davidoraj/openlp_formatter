How Great Thou Art
Verse 1:
1. O LORD my God
When I in awesome wonder
Consider all the works
Thy hand hath made
I see the stars
I hear the mighty thunder
Thy pow’r throughout
The universe displayed

Chorus:[2]
Then sings my soul
My Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art!
How great Thou art!
Then sings my soul
My Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art!
How great Thou art!

Verse 2:
2. And when I think
That God, His Son not sparing
Sent Him to die
I scarce can take it in
That on the Cross
My burden gladly bearing
He bled and died
To take away my sin

Chorus

Verse 3:
3. When Christ shall come
With shout of acclamation
And take me home
What joy shall fill my heart!
Then shall I bow
In humble adoration
And there proclaim
My God how great Thou art!

Bridge:
Until that day
When heaven bids us welcome
And as we walk
This broken warring world
Your kingdom come
Deliver us from evil
And we’ll proclaim
Our God how great You are!
With hope we'll sing
Our God how great You are!

Chorus

Chorus 2:
How great Thou art!
How great Thou art! (2)
