How Great Thou Art
Verse 1:
O LORD my God
When I in awesome wonder
Consider all the works Thy hand hath made
I see the stars, I hear the mighty thunder
Thy pow’r throughout the universe displayed

Chorus:
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee
How great Thou art! How great Thou art!
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee
How great Thou art! How great Thou art!

Verse 2:
And when I think that God, His Son not sparing
Sent Him to die - I scarce can take it in
That on the Cross, my burden gladly bearing
He bled and died to take away my sin

Chorus

Verse 3:
When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
And take me home - what joy shall fill my heart!
Then shall I bow in humble adoration
And there proclaim, my God how great Thou art!

Bridge:
Until that day When heaven bids us welcome
And as we walk this broken warring world
Your kingdom come, Deliver us from evil
And we’ll proclaim our God how great You are!
With hope we'll sing our God how great You are!

Chorus

Chorus 2:
How great Thou art! How great Thou art!
How great Thou art! How great Thou art!
