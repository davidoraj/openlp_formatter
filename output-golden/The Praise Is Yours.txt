The Praise Is Yours
Verse 1:
Infinite
Self-existent
Beyond the end
Before beginning
Eternal One, Creator God
You made the world and it was good

Verse 2:
All in all
Self-sufficient
So high above
But never distant
Made for Your love
Fashioned from dust
You gave us breath and it was good

Chorus:
All the glory and honor
Blessing and power
Because Your name alone is worthy
Worthy forever
The praise is Yours

Verse 3:
We hid our face, separated
Betrayed Your heart
Our glory faded
Went our own way
Gave up on love
But You would not, for You are good

Verse 4:
You sent Your Son
For our forgiveness
You ran to us
You kept Your promise
Light of the world
There on a cross
You drank the cup for You are good

Oh-oh oh-oh
