The Praise Is Yours
Verse 1:
1. Infinite, self-existent
Beyond the end, before beginning
Eternal One, Creator God
You made the world and it was good

Verse 2:
2. All in all, self-sufficient
So high above, but never distant
Made for Your love, fashioned from dust
You gave us breath and it was good

Chorus:[2]
All the glory and honor
Blessing and power
Because Your name alone is worthy
Worthy forever, the praise is Yours

Verse 3:
3. We hid our face, separated
Betrayed Your heart, our glory faded
Went our own way, gave up on love
But You would not, for You are good

Verse 4:
You sent Your Son for our forgiveness
You ran to us, You kept Your promise
Light of the world, there on a cross
You drank the cup for You are good
