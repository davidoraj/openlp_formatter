Build My Life
Verse 1:
Worthy of every song we could ever sing
Worthy of all the praise we could ever bring

Pre-chorus:
Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe
We live for you, Oh we live for you

Verse 2:
Jesus, the Name above every other name
Jesus, the only One who could ever save

Pre-chorus

Chorus:[3]
Holy, there is no one like You
There is none beside You
Open up my eyes in wonder
Show me who You are and fill me
With Your heart and lead me
In your love to those around me

Verse 2
Pre-chorus
Chorus

Bridge:
I will build my life upon Your love
It is a firm foundation
I will put my trust in You alone
And I will not be shaken
