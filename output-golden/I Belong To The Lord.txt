I Belong To The Lord
Verse 1:
1. The One who made the heavens
Made my heart and soul
Before I drew a breath
I was loved and known
I am His creation
The Maker's masterpiece
And all that He designs
Will be done in me

Verse 2:
2. My body is a temple
Of the living God
I'll worship in this house
That His blood has bought
As I bear His image
Oh, may I not profane
The holiness I hold
In this earthly frame

Chorus:
I belong to the Lord, Oh I am not my own
I belong to the Lord, I am not my own
I will honor Him for this I know
I belong to the Lord, I am not my own

Verse 3:
3. And if He has redeemed me
I am not my own
The measure of my worth
Is His love alone
He declares my standing
And He declares my state
So I will know myself
By the name He gave

Chorus

Verse 4:
4. I am not my own and
Now my heart is free
O Maker come and make
What You will of me
There is nothing broken
That You cannot repair
So Lord, I leave my life
In Your loving care

Chorus

Chorus 2:
I will honor Him for this I know
I belong to the Lord, I am not my own
