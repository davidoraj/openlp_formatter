Isn't He good
Verse 1:
1. I was lost and He found me
I was sick and He healed me
I was dead and He raised me up again
I was bound and He freed me
Now I stand in His victory
I was desperate and He saved me from my sin

Chorus:
Isn't He good
Isn't He great
Isn't He faithful
Look at my life
Look what He's done
Isn't He able
Isn't He good
Isn't He great
Isn't He worthy

Chorus 2:
Oh He's worthy
He's worthy, isn't He!

Verse 2:
2. Mighty God, Jehovah
Holy One, Messiah
All the glory to our resurrected King
