Just As I Am
Verse 1:
1. Just as I am without one plea
But that Thy blood was shed for me
And that Thou bidd'st me come to Thee
O Lamb of God I come, I come

Verse 2:
2. Just as I am and waiting not
To rid my soul of one dark blot
To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot
O Lamb of God I come, I come

Verse 3:
3. Just as I am though tossed about
With many a conflict many a doubt
Fightings and fears within without
O Lamb of God I come, I come

Verse 4:
4. Just as I am, Thou wilt receive
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve
Because Thy promise I believe
O Lamb of God I come, I come
