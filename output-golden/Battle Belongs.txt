Battle Belongs
Verse 1:
1. When all I see is the battle
You see my victory
When all I see is the mountain
You see a mountain moved
And as I walk through the shadow
Your love surrounds me
There's nothing to fear now
For I am safe with You

Chorus:
So when I fight
I'll fight on my knees
With my hands lifted high
Oh God, the battle belongs to You
And every fear
I lay at Your feet
I'll sing through the night
Oh God, the battle belongs to You

Verse 2:
2. And if You are for me
Who can be against me?
For Jesus, there's nothing
Impossible for You
When all I see are the ashes
You see the beauty
When all I see is a cross
God, You see the empty tomb

Chorus

Bridge:
Almighty fortress
You go before us
Nothing can stand against
The power of our God
You shine in the shadow
You win every battle
Nothing can stand against
The power of our God

Bridge
