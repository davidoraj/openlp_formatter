Good Good Father
Verse 1:
1. I've heard a thousand stories
Of what they think you're like
But I've heard the tender whisper
Of love in the dead of night
And you tell me that you're pleased
And that I'm never alone

Chorus:
You're a Good, Good Father
It's who you are (3)
And I'm loved by you
It's who I am (3)

Verse 2:
2. And I've seen many searching
For answers far and wide
But I know we're all searching
For answers only you provide
'Cause you know just what we need
Before we say a word

Chorus

Bridge:
You are perfect
In all of your ways (2)
You are perfect in
All of your ways to us

Bridge

Verse 3:
3. It's love so undeniable
I, I can hardly speak
Peace so unexplainable
I, I can hardly think
As you call me deeper still
As you call me deeper still
As you call me deeper still
Into love, love, love

Chorus
