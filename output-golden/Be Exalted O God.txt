Be Exalted O God
Verse:
I will give thanks to Thee
O Lord, among the peoples
I will sing praises to Thee
Among the nations
For Thy stead-fast love is great
Is great to the heavens
And Thy faithfulness
Thy faithfulness to the clouds

Chorus:
Be ex-alt-ed, O God, above the heavens
Let Thy glory be over all the earth
Be ex-alt-ed, O God, above the heavens
Let Thy glory be over all the earth

Verse

Chorus 2:
Be ex-alt-ed, O God, above the heavens
Let Thy glory be over all the earth
Be ex-alt-ed, O God, above the heavens
Let Thy glory, Let Thy glory
Let Thy glory be over all the earth
