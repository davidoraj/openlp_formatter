Love Of God
Verse 1:
It's so good
I almost can't believe it
Far beyond
What hearts could ever dream
The God who set
The galaxies in motion
Would descend
To give His life for me
For what could make
Perfection bleed for sinners
What leads a King
To pay so great a cost
All my life
My heart will sing the answer
Only the love of God

Chorus:[3]
Singing O how great is the love of God
He paid our debt
On that rugged cross
For all our days
We will sing our Savior's praise
How great is the love of God

Verse 2:
It's so kind
It leads us to repentance
And it's so bright
The darkness has to flee
Hallelujah!
It cleared my guilty sentence
For I was bound
But now I stand redeemed
For what could break
The chains of any prison?
What force could rob
The power from the grave?
What would trade
My rags for heaven's riches?
Only the love of God

Chorus

Verse 3:
Though I try
My mind can't comprehend it
It's so high
Too marvelous for words
I could sing
A million songs about it
And barely scratch
The surface of Your worth
This all my life
The banner I'll be waving
My anthem cry
No matter what may come
And when I rise
To walk the streets of heaven
I'll still be singing this song
For everything that You've done
How great the love of God

Chorus
