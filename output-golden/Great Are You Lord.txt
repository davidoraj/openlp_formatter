Great Are You Lord
Verse:
You give life, You are love
You bring light to the darkness
You give hope, You restore
Every heart that is broken
Great are You, Lord

Chorus:
It's Your breath
In our lungs
So we pour out our praise
We pour out our praise
It's Your breath
In our lungs
So we pour out our praise
To You only
