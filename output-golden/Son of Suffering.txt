Son of Suffering
Verse 1:
1. Oh, the perfect Son of God
In all His innocence
Here walking in the dirt with you and me
He knows what living is
He's acquainted with our grief
Man of sorrows, Son of suffering

Chorus 1:
The blood and tears
How can it be?
There's a God who weeps
There's a God who bleeds
Oh, praise the One
Who would reach for me
Hallelujah to the Son of suffering

Verse 2:
2. Some imagine You
Are distant and removed
But You chased us down in merciful pursuit
To the sinner You were grace
And the broken You embraced
And in the end, the proof is in Your wounds
Yes, in the end, the proof is in Your wounds

Bridge:
Your cross, my freedom
Your stripes, my healing
All praise King Jesus
Glory to God in Heaven
Your blood, still speaking
Your love, still reaching
All praise King Jesus
Glory to God forever
