Lead Me To The Cross
Verse 1:[3]
Savior I come
Quiet my soul,
Remember
Redemption's hill
Where Your blood was shed
For my ransom

Pre-chorus:
Everything I once held dear
I count it all as lost

Chorus:
Lead me to the cross
Where Your love poured out
Bring me to my knees
Lord I lay me down
Rid me of myself
I belong to You
Oh, lead me, lead me to the cross

Verse 2:[3]
You were as I
Tempted and trialed
Human
The word became flesh
Bore my sin and death
Now you're risen

Pre-chorus
Chorus

Bridge:
To Your heart
To Your heart
Lead me to Your heart
Lead me to Your heart

Chorus
