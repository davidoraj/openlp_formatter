One Day
Verse 1:
1. One day You’ll make
Everything new, Jesus
One day You will
Bind every wound
The former things shall all pass away
No more tears

Verse 2:[3]
2. One day You’ll make
Sense of it all, Jesus
One day every question resolved
Every anxious thought left behind
No more fear

Chorus:
When we all get to heaven
What a day of rejoicing that will be
When we all see Jesus
We'll sing and shout the victory

Verse 3:[3]
3. One day we will see
Face to face, Jesus
Is there a greater vision of grace
And in a moment, we shall be changed
On that day

Verse 4:[3]
And one day we’ll be free
Free indeed, Jesus
One day all this struggle will cease
And we will see Your glory revealed
On that day
