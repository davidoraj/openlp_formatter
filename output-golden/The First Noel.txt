The First Noel
Verse 1:
1. The first Noel
The angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay
In fields where they
Lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night
That was so deep

Chorus:
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Is-ra-el

Verse 2:
2. They looked up
And saw a star
Shining in the east
Beyond them far
And to the earth
It gave great light
And so it continued
Both day and night

Chorus

Verse 3:
3. Then entered in
Those Wise Men three
Full reverently
Upon the knee
And offered there
In his presence
Their gold and myrrh
And frankincense

Chorus

Verse 4:
4. Then let us all
With one accord
Sing praises to
Our heavenly Lord
That hath made heav'n
And earth of naught
And with his blood
Mankind hath bought

Chorus
