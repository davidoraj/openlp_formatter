Is He Worthy
Verse 1:
Do you feel the world is broken? (We do)
Do you feel the shadows deepen? (We do)
But do you know that all the dark won't stop
The light from getting through? (We do)
Do you wish that you could
See it all made new? (We do)

Verse 2:
Is all creation groaning? (It is)
Is a new creation coming? (It is)
Is the glory of the Lord to be
The light within our midst? (It is)
Is it good that we
Remind ourselves of this? (It is)

Chorus 1:
Is anyone worthy?
Is anyone whole?
Is anyone able to break the seal
And open the scroll?
The Lion of Judah
Who conquered the grave
He is David's root and the Lamb who died
To ransom the slave

Pre-chorus 1:
Is He worthy? Is He worthy?
Of all blessing and honor and glory
Is He worthy of this?
He is

Verse 3:
Does the Father truly love us? (He does)
Does the Spirit move among us? (He does)
And does Jesus, our Messiah,
Hold forever those He loves? (He does)
Does our God intend
To dwell again with us? (He does)

Chorus 1

Bridge:
From every people and tribe
Every nation and tongue
He has made us a kingdom and priests to God
To reign with the Son

Pre-chorus 2:
Is He worthy? Is He worthy?
Of all blessing and honor and glory
Is He worthy? Is He worthy?
Is He worthy of this?

Chorus 2:
He is! He is!
Is He worthy? Is He worthy?
He is! He is!
He is worthy! He is worthy!
He is!
