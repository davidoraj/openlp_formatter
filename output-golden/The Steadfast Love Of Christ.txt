The Steadfast Love Of Christ
Verse 1:
1. Once my heart was a prison
Defiled and cold
Where sin and the enemy reigned
I was bound by the chains that
Enslaved my soul
No hint of repentance or shame
But then Jesus appeared
Like the morning sun
Defeating the shadows with light
And forgiveness flowed
Through His precious blood
Oh the steadfast love of Christ

Verse 2:
2. Though redeemed I still battle
The lies within
That silently war in my soul
In my weakness I yield
To the power of sin
And desperately cry out for hope
But then grace rushes in
Like a mighty flood
New strength to engage in the fight
And I taste the freedom
The cross has won
Through the steadfast love of Christ

Verse 3:
3. All the world is accursed
And in sorrow still
As heartache and suffering remain
But the hope of creation
Will be fulfilled
Our Savior is coming to reign
I believe in the justice
Of God the Son
I know faith will turn into sight
Every tear stain dried
Every wound undone
By the steadfast love of Christ

Bridge:
All of Heaven will quake
When we see our King
The Lamb on the throne, lifted high
Weâ€™ll behold in awe and forever sing
Of the steadfast love of Christ
Oh, the steadfast love of Christ
