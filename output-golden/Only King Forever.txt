Only King Forever
Verse 1:
Our God, a firm foundation
Our rock, the only solid ground
As nations
Rise and fall
Kingdoms once strong now shaken
But we trust forever in your name
The name of Jesus
We trust the name of Jesus

Chorus:
You are the only King forever
Almighty God we lift You higher
You are the only King forever
Forevermore, you are victorious

Verse 2:
Unmatched in all your wisdom
In love and justice you will reign
Every knee will bow
We bring our expectations
Our hope is anchored in your name
The name of Jesus
We trust the name of Jesus

Chorus

Bridge:
We lift our banner high
We lift the name of Jesus
From age to age you reign
Your kingdom has no end
