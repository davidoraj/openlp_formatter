When I Survey The Wondrous Cross
Verse 1:
1. When I survey the wondrous Cross
On which the Prince of Glory died
My richest gain, I count but loss
And pour contempt on all my pride

Verse 2:
2. See from His head, His hands, His feet
Sorrow and love flow mingled down
Did ever such love and sorrow meet?
Or thorns compose, so rich a crown

Chorus 1:
Oh the wonderful Cross
Oh the wonderful Cross
Bids me come and die
And find that I may truly live

Verse 3:
3. Were the whole realm of nature mine
That were an offering far too small
Love so amazing, so divine
Demands my soul, my life, my all

Chorus 1

Chorus 2:
Oh the wonderful Cross
Oh the wonderful Cross
All who gather here
By grace draw near and bless Your name

Verse 4:
Love so amazing, so divine
Demands my soul, my life, my all

Chorus 1
Chorus 2
