Cornerstone
Verse 1:[3]
1. Lookin' out my window
Feelin' the crescendo
Sunset on a quiet sea
Sitting with the ones that
I'll forever love we're
Waitin' on a flash of green
And even when the nights got cold
-
You have always held me close (me close)
You're the only rock that
I could ever stand on
You're the only one for me

Pre-chorus 1:
The sun goes up, the sun comes down
This old world keeps spinnin' around
I'm here travelin'
Down this long and winding road
Seasons come and seasons go
They take me high, then leave me low
But I'm still standing
on the only rock I know

Chorus 1:
You're my cornerstone, oh, oh, oh
No matter where I go, my cornerstone

Verse 2:[3]
Bible by my bedside
Sweatin' through a long night
Wrestling the hounds of shame
Tryna turn the hands back
On a troublin' past
Every move I make's in vain
But even in the shifting winds
-
You are who You've always been
You're the only rock that
I could ever stand on
Through it all You remain

Pre-chorus 1
Chorus 1

Bridge:
On Christ, the solid rock I'm standin'
All of the ground is sinking sand
On Christ, the solid rock I'm standin'
All of the ground is sinking sand
On Christ, the solid rock I'm standin'
You're the only one that
I will build my life on
Through it all You remain

Pre-chorus 2:
The sun goes up, the sun comes down
This old world keeps spinnin' around
And I'm here travelin'
Down this long and winding road
Seasons come, seasons go
I've been high and I've been low
But I'm standing on the only rock I know

Chorus 2:
You're my cornerstone
Oh, oh, oh, No matter where I go
All of the ground is sinking sand
Oh, oh, oh, You are the only rock I stand on
Oh, oh, All of the ground is sinking sand
You are the only rock I stand on
