To God Be The Glory
Verse 1:
1. To God be the glory
Great things he hath done
So loved he the world
That he gave us his son
Who yielded his life
An atonement for sin
And opened the lifegate
That all may go in

Chorus:
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord
Let the earth hear his voice
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord
Let the people rejoice
O come to the Father
Through Jesus the Son
And give him the glory
Great things he hath done

Verse 2:
2. Oh, perfect redemption
The purchase of blood
To every believer
The promise of God
The vilest offender
Who truly believes
That moment from Jesus
A pardon receives

Chorus

Verse 3:
3. Great things he hath taught us
Great things he hath done
And great our rejoicing
Through Jesus the Son
But purer, and higher
And greater will be
Our wonder, our transport
When Jesus we see

Chorus
