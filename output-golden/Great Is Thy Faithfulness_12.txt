Great Is Thy Faithfulness
Verse 1:
1. Great is Thy faithfulness
O God my Father
There is no shadow
Of turning with Thee
Thou changest not
Thy compassions they fail not
As Thou hast been
Thou-for-ever wilt be

Chorus:
Great is Thy faithfulness
Great is Thy faithfulness
Morning by morning
New mercies I see
All I have needed
Thy hand hath provided
Great is Thy faithfulness
Lord unto me

Verse 2:
2. Summer and winter
And springtime and harvest
Sun, moon and stars
In their courses above
Join with all nature
In manifold witness
To Thy great faithfulness
Mercy and love
