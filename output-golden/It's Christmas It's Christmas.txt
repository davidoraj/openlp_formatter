It's Christmas It's Christmas
Verse 1:
everyone is joyful 
there’s singing everywhere 
do you know the reason 
it’s Christmas time again
the trees and stars and gifts and cakes 
are filled just everywhere 
but don’t forget the reason that
you and i must share 

Chorus:
it’s Christmas, it’s Christmas 
come join us in the song 
it’s Christmas, it’s Christmas 
let’s rejoice and get along (2) 

Pre-chorus:
the birth of Jesus is 
the most important thing 
He came so we could all be 
forgiven of our sins (2)

Chorus

Verse 2:
the streets are filled with caroling 
and a star on every house 
the festive spirit Christmas brings 
makes everyone rejoice 
let’s spread the joy the love and warmth 
to the people that we meet 
share the good news to your friends 
and give them a Christmas treat
