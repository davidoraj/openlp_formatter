Better Is One Day
Verse 1:
How lovely is Your dwelling place
Oh Lord Almighty
For my soul longs
And even faints for You
For here my heart is satisfied
Within Your presence
I sing beneath
The shadow of Your wings

Chorus:
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere (2)

Verse 2:
One thing I ask and I would seek
To see Your beauty
To find You in
The place Your glory dwells

Verse 2

Chorus

Bridge:[3]
My heart and flesh cry out
For You, the living God
Your Spirit's water to my soul
I've tasted and I've seen
Come once again to me
I will draw near to You (2)

Chorus
