We Three Kings of Orient Are
Verse 1:
1. We three kings of Orient are
Bearing gifts we traverse afar
Field and fountain, moor and mountain
Following yonder star

Chorus:
O star of wonder star of light
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading still proceeding
Guide us to Thy perfect light

Verse 2:
2. Born a King on Bethlehem's plain
Gold I bring to crown him again
King forever ceasing never
over us all to reign

Verse 3:
3. Frankincense to offer have I
Incense owns a Deity nigh
Prayer and praising voices raising
Worshiping God on high

Chorus

Verse 4:
4. Myrrh is mine its bitter perfume
Breathes a life of gathering gloom
Sorrowing sighing bleeding dying
Sealed in the stone-cold tomb

Verse 5:
5. Glorious now behold him arise
King and God and sacrifice
Alleluia, Alleluia
Sounds through the earth and skies

Chorus
