No Longer Slaves
Verse 1:
You unravel me with a melody
You surround me with a song
Of deliverance from my enemies
Till all my fears are gone

Chorus:
I’m no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God (2)

Verse 2:
From my mother’s womb, You have chosen me
Your love has called my name
I’ve been born again into Your family
Your blood flows through my veins

Chorus

Bridge:
You split the sea so I could walk right through it
You drowned my fears in perfect love
You rescued me so I could stand and sing
I am a child of God

Bridge
