Christ Our Wisdom
Verse 1:
1. Christ our wisdom, we are humbled
When You hide Your ways from us
You have purposes unnumbered
Each one good and glorious 
Help us trust when we grow weary 
Free us from our anxious thoughts 
Give us grace to see more clearly  
You are God and we are not    

Verse 2:
2. Christ our wisdom, be our gladness
When we fail to understand
You ordain all joy and sadness
To fulfill Your perfect plan
Help us know You rule with power
Over every raging flood
In our most uncertain hour 
You are God and we are loved
 
Verse 3:
3. Christ our wisdom, we will follow
Though the way ahead is veiled
As we journey through the shadows 
Grant us faith where sight has failed 
Help us cling to Your commandments 
Strengthened by Your faithful Word 
We will never be abandoned 
You are God and we are Yours  

Verse 4:
4. Christ our wisdom we adore You
For the beauty of the cross
Once in foolishness we scorned You
But Your blood has ransomed us
Help us sing the endless mercies
Of Your humble heart to save 
Christ our wisdom, Christ our glory
You are God forever praised

Chorus 4:
Help us sing the endless mercies
Of Your humble heart to save 
Christ our wisdom, Christ our glory
You are God forever praised
