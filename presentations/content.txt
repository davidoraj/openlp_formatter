#The Word [The Bible]
==
*The first, logos, refers principally to the total inspired Word of God and to Jesus, who is the living Word*
  * The more commonly known of these two Greek words is logos. In the New Testament, logos is used to refer to
    the constant, written word, which is recorded in the Bible
==
*The first, logos, refers principally to the total inspired Word of God and to Jesus, who is the living Word*
  * When we read the written word, we learn about God and know His ways, His salvation and His plan for mankind.
  * Without the logos, we would have no way to know God’s purpose, or our place in that purpose.
  * We would be left to wonder or guess what His intention is. But we have to thank God for giving us the Bible,
    which communicates to us who He is and what He desires.
