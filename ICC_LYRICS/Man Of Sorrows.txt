Man Of Sorrows
Verse 1:
Man of sorrows Lamb of God
By His own betrayed
The sin of man and wrath of God
Has been on Jesus laid

Verse 2:
Silent as He stood accused
Beaten mocked and scorned
Bowing to the Father’s will
He took a crown of thorns

Chorus:
Oh that rugged cross my salvation
Where Your love poured out over me
Now my soul cries out hallelujah
Praise and honour unto Thee

Verse 3:
Sent of heaven God’s own Son
To purchase and redeem
And reconcile the very ones
Who nailed Him to that tree

Chorus

Bridge:[4]
Now my debt is paid
It is paid in full
By the precious blood
That my Jesus spilled
Now the curse of sin
Has no hold on me
Whom the Son sets free
Oh is free indeed

Bridge

Chorus

Verse 4:
See the stone is rolled away
Behold the empty tomb
Hallelujah God be praised
He’s risen from the grave

Chorus

Chorus 2:
Praise and honour unto Thee
