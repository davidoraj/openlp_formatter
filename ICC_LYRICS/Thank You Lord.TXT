Thank You Lord
Verse 1:
1. I come
Before You today
And there's just one thing
That I want to say
Thank You, Lord
Thank You, Lord
For all
You've given to me
For all the blessings
That I cannot see
Thank You, Lord
Thank You, Lord

Pre-chorus:
With a grateful heart
With a song of praise
With an outstretched arm
I will bless Your name

Chorus:
Thank You Lord
I just want to thank You Lord (2)

Verse 2:
2. For all
You've done in my life
You took my darkness
And gave me Your light
Thank You, Lord
Thank You, Lord
You took my
Sin and my shame
You took my sickness
And healed all my pain
Thank You, Lord
Thank You, Lord
