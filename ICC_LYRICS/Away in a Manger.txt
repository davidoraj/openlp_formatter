1. Away in a manger
No crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus
Laid down his sweet head
The stars in the bright sky
Looked down where he lay
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep on the hay

2. The cattle are lowing
The baby awakes
But little Lord Jesus
No crying he makes
I love you Lord Jesus
Look down from the sky
And stay by my side
Until morning is nigh.

3. Be near me Lord Jesus
I ask you to stay
Close by me forever
And love me I pray
Bless all the dear children
In your tender care
And take us to heaven
To live with you there
