That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appear

Who to your tribes on Sinai's height

Unto your own and rescue them
From depths of hell your people save

And open wide our heavenly home
Make safe for us the heavenward road

And bring us comfort from afar
Dispel the shadows of the night
And turn our darkness into light

In one the hearts of all mankind
Bid all our sad divisions cease
And be yourself our King of Peace
