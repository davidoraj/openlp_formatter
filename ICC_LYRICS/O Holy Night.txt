O Holy Night
Verse 1:
1. O holy night!
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night
Of the dear Savior’s birth
Long lay the world
In sin and error pining
Till He appeared
And the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn!
Fall on your knees!
O hear the angel voices!
O night divine
O night when Christ was born!
O night divine 
O night, O night divine

Verse 2:
2. Led by the light
Of faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts
By His cradle we stand
So led by light
Of a star sweetly gleaming
Here came the Wise Men
From Orient land
The King of kings
Lay thus in lowly manger
In all our trials
Born to be our Friend
He knows our need
To-our-weakness is no stranger
Behold your King
Before Him lowly bend!
Behold your King
Before Him lowly bend!

Verse 3:
3. Truly He taught us
To love one another
His law is love
And His gospel is peace
Chains shall He break
For the slave is our brother
And in His name
All oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in
Grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us
Praise His holy name
Christ is the Lord!
O praise His name forever!
His pow’r and glory evermore
Evermore proclaim!
His pow’r and glory evermore
Evermore proclaim!
