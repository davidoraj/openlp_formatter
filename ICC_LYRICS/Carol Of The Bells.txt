Carol Of The Bells
Verse 1:
Hark! how the bells
Sweet silver bells
All seem to say
"Throw cares away."
Christmas is here
Bringing good cheer
To young and old
Meek and the bold

Verse 2:
Ding, dong, ding, dong
That is their song
With joyful ring
All caroling
One seems to hear
Words of good cheer
From ev'rywhere
Filling the air

Verse 3a: (HIGH)
Oh how they pound
Raising the sound
O'er hill and dale
Telling their tale

Verse 3b:
Joyf'ly they ring
While people sing
Songs of good cheer
Christmas is here

Chorus:
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas

Verse 4:
On, on they send
On without end
Their joyful tone
To ev'ry home
