Count Your Blessings
Verse 1:
1. When upon life's billows
You are tempest tossed
When you are discouraged
Thinking all is lost
Count your many blessings
Name them one by one
And it will surprise you
What the Lord hath done

Chorus:
Count your blessings
Name them one by one
Count your blessings
See what God hath done
Count your blessings
Name them one by one
Count your many blessings
See what God hath done

Verse 2:
2. Are you ever burdened
With a load of care?
Does the cross seem heavy
You are called to bear?
Count your many blessings
Every doubt will fly
And you will be singing
As the days go by

Chorus

Verse 3:
3. When you look at others
With their lands and gold
Think that Christ has promised
You His wealth untold
Count your many blessings
Money cannot buy
Your reward in heaven
Nor your home on high

Chorus

Verse 4:
4. So amid the conflict
Whether great or small
Do not be discouraged
God is over all
Count your many blessings
Angels will attend
Help and comfort give you
To your journey's end

Chorus

Though I'm very weak and ill
From His shining throne on high

Then His little child will take
Up to heav'n for His dear sake

Storms about me, night overtakes me,
He, my Pilot, hears my cry.

More than all in Him I find.
He hath granted me forgiveness,
I am His, and He is mine.
