Praise To The Lord The Almighty
Verse 1:
1. Praise to the Lord, the Almighty,
The King of creation!
O my soul, praise Him, for He is thy
Health and salvation!
All ye who hear
Now to His temple draw near
Sing now in glad adoration!

Verse 2:
2. Praise to the Lord, who oâ€™er all things
So wondrously reigneth,
Who, as on wings of an eagle,
Uplifteth, sustaineth
Hast thou not seen
How thy desires all have been
Granted in what He ordaineth?

Verse 3:
3. Praise to the Lord, who hath fearfully,
Wondrously, made thee!
Health hath vouchsafed and when
Heedlessly falling, hath stayed thee
What need or grief
Ever hath failed of relief?
Wings of His mercy did shade thee.

Verse 4:
4. Praise to the Lord, who doth prosper
Thy work and defend thee,
Who from the heavens the streams of
His mercy doth send thee
Ponder anew
What the Almighty can do,
Who with His love doth befriend thee.

Verse 5:
5. Praise to the Lord! Oh, let all that
Is in me adore Him!
All that hath life and breath, come now
With praises before Him!
Let the Amen
Sound from His people again
Gladly for aye we adore Him.

Bridge:
Let the Amen
Sound from His people again
Gladly for aye we adore Him.

How Great Is Our God
Verse 1:
The splendor of a King
Clothed in majesty
Let all the Earth rejoice
All the Earth rejoice
He wraps himself in light
And darkness tries to hide
And trembles at His voice
Trembles at His voice

Chorus:
How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God
And all will see how great
How great is our God

Verse 2:
Age to age He stands
And time is in His hands
Beginning and the end
Beginning and the end
The Godhead Three in One
Father Spirit Son
The Lion and the Lamb
The Lion and the Lamb

Chorus

Bridge:
Name above all names
Worthy of our praise
My heart will sing
How great is our God
