Reckless Love
Verse 1:
Before I spoke a word
You were singing over me
You have been so..
So good to me
Before I took a breath
You breathed Your life in me
You have been so..
So kind to me

Chorus:[3]
Oh, the overwhelming
Never-ending
Reckless love of God
Oh, it chases me down
Fights ‘til I’m found
Leaves the ninety-nine
I couldn’t earn it
I don’t deserve it
Still You give Yourself away
Oh, the overwhelming
Never-ending
Reckless love of God

Verse 2:
When I was Your foe
Still Your love fought for me
You have been so..
So good to me
When I felt no worth
You paid it all for me
You have been so..
So kind to me

Chorus

Bridge:[3]
There’s no shadow You won’t light up
Mountain You won’t climb up
Coming after me
There’s no wall You won’t kick down
Lie You won’t tear down
Coming after me
