The First Noel
Verse 1:
1. The first Noel
The angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay
In fields where they
Lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night
That was so deep

Chorus:
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Is-ra-el

Verse 2:
2. They looked up
And saw a star
Shining in the east
Beyond them far
And to the earth
It gave great light
And so it continued
Both day and night

Chorus

Verse 3:
3. Then entered in
Those Wise Men three
Full reverently
Upon the knee
And offered there
In his presence
Their gold and myrrh
And frankincense

Chorus

Verse 4:
4. Then let us all
With one accord
Sing praises to
Our heavenly Lord
That hath made heav'n
And earth of naught
And with his blood
Mankind hath bought

Chorus

ఆకాశాన్న వెలిగింది తార
ఆ తారకర్ధం శ్రీ యేసు జననం

ఆ నిశిధ రాత్రి
లోకానికే దివ్య రాత్రి

ఆ నిశిధ రాత్రి
లోకానికే దివ్య రాత్రి (2)

1. యోహోవ వరమై అరుదెంచె నిలకు
మరియమ్మ వొడిలోన యేసే 
నవకాంతులన్ని లోకాన్న వెలిగే
పాపాలు పరిహార మాయే

2. దివిలోన దూతల్ స్తుతి గీతిపాడే
నీ దివ్య నామంపు మహిమా
మెమంత పాడి నిను కీర్తింతుం
నీ దివ్య సందేశ మివ్వ

3. అపరంజి బోళం సాంబ్రాణులన్ని
కానుకలిచ్చారు జ్ఞానుల్
మా పేద మనసు నీ కిచ్చుకొందం
మము కావుమో బాలయేసు

O Holy Night
Verse 1:
1. O holy night!
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night
Of the dear Savior’s birth
Long lay the world
In sin and error pining
Till He appeared
And the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn!
Fall on your knees!
O hear the angel voices!
O night divine
O night when Christ was born!
O night divine 
O night, O night divine

Verse 3:
3. Truly He taught us
To love one another
His law is love
And His gospel is peace
Chains shall He break
For the slave is our brother
And in His name
All oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in
Grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us
Praise His holy name
Christ is the Lord!
O praise His name forever!
His pow’r and glory evermore
Evermore proclaim!
His pow’r and glory evermore
Evermore proclaim!

All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heav’nly hosts sing, Alleluia
Christ the Savior is born

Son of God love’s pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord at thy birth
Jesus Lord at thy birth
