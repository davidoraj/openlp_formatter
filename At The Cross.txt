At The Cross
Verse 1:
1. Alas! And did my Savior bleed
And did my Sovereign die?
Would He devote that sacred head
For such a worm as I?

Chorus:[3]
At the cross, at the cross
Where I first saw the light
And the burden of my heart rolled away
It was there by faith
I received my sight
And now I am happy all the day

Verse 2:
2. Was it for crimes that I had done
He groaned upon the tree?
Amazing pity! Grace unknown!
And love beyond degree!

Chorus

Verse 3:
3. Well might the sun in darkness hide
And shut his glories in
When Christ, the mighty Maker died
For man the creature’s sin

Chorus

Verse 4:
4. Thus might I hide my blushing face
While His dear cross appears
Dissolve my heart in thankfulness
And melt my eyes to tears

Chorus

Verse 5:
5. But drops of grief can ne’er repay
The debt of love I owe
Here, Lord, I give my self away
’Tis all that I can do

Chorus
